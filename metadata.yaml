description: "The Common Law is a book that was written by Oliver Wendell Holmes,\
  \ Jr. in 1881. Holmes later (1902) became an Associate Justice on the Supreme Court\
  \ of the United States.\nThe book is about common law in the United States, including\
  \ torts, property, contracts, and crime. It is written as a series of lectures.\
  \ It has gone out of copyright and is available in full on the web at Project Gutenberg.\n\
  One of the most famous aphorisms to be drawn from this book occurs on the first\
  \ page: \"The life of the law has not been logic; it has been experience,\" a subtle\
  \ qualification of the famous seventeenth-century English jurist Sir Edward Coke's\
  \ dictum that \"Reason is the life of the law.\"\n From Wikipedia (CC BY-SA)."
